To run a Python script with the py launcher, simply substitute py and its command-line switches for python or python3. For instance, here is the command typically used to upgrade pip by running it as a module:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
```

If we have the py launcher, we just type (default version):

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
```

O use a specific version:

```bash
py -3.9 -m pip install -U pip
```
